## üéØ Overview

GAMECHANGER prioritizes weapons, sensors, and tactical systems with 30-40+ comprehensive bindings. The AI-powered system uses **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** to intelligently map controls based on real manuals by extracting text and images from aircraft and controller PDFs using PyMuPDF. It automatically detects unified vs multi-device HOTAS setups and generates installation-ready configuration files in simulator-native formats.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Mapping**: Uses **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** to analyze manuals and generate optimal control mappings.
- **üìÑ PDF Analysis**: Extracts text and images from both aircraft and controller manuals.
- **üéÆ Multi-Device Support**: Handles unified HOTAS, multi-device setups, single joysticks, and gamepads.
- **üéØ Combat-Focused**: Prioritizes weapons, sensors, and tactical systems.
- **üì¶ Ready-to-Use**: Generates installation-ready configuration files.
- **üîß Multiple Simulators**: Supports 8 major flight simulators.

## üìã Requirements

- **Python**: 3.12 or higher
- **Google Gemini API key**: Free tier available at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- **PDF manuals**: Aircraft and/or controller manuals (optional but recommended)

### Python Dependencies
```text
streamlit>=1.28.0
google-genai>=0.2.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
pymupdf>=1.24.0
Pillow>=10.0.0
```

## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to get GAMECHANGER running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gamechangerai.git
cd gamechangerai
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects or your system's Python installation.

Create the environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

**On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
With your virtual environment active, install the required Python packages using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Key
Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project directory. This file will securely store your Google API key.

Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual key:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

You can get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## üíª Usage
Launch the desired Streamlit application from your terminal.

**Main Application (All Simulators)**
Run the main Streamlit application for general use:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

**DCS World Specific**
For a configuration experience focused on DCS World:
```bash
streamlit run main_dcs.py
```

**Multi-Device Configuration**
For advanced multi-device HOTAS setups (e.g., separate stick, throttle, and pedals):
```bash
streamlit run main_multiconfig.py
```

**Unified HOTAS**
For unified/all-in-one controllers (e.g., VelocityOne Flightstick):
```bash
streamlit run main_flightstick.py
```

**Stick + Throttle**
For traditional separate stick and throttle setups:
```bash
streamlit run main_sticknthrottle.py
```

## üìñ How It Works
**1. Select Your Simulator**
Choose from 8 supported flight simulators. The system automatically adapts to the correct file format and configuration structure.

**2. Upload Aircraft Manual (Optional)**
Upload the aircraft flight manual PDF. The AI will extract:
- Text content for control descriptions
- Cockpit diagrams and images
- Systems information
- Weapon and sensor details

**3. Select Controller Setup**
Choose your HOTAS configuration. The system detects:
- Unified vs multi-device setup
- Available axes and buttons
- Device capabilities

**4. Upload Controller Manuals (Optional)**
Upload manuals for each device component:
- Flight stick manual
- Throttle manual
- Rudder pedals manual
- Additional control panels

**5. Generate Configuration**
Click "Generate Profile" and GAMECHANGER will:
- Analyze all uploaded documents
- Extract text and images using PyMuPDF
- Send to **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** for intelligent mapping
- Generate complete configuration files
- Create detailed installation instructions

**6. Download & Install**
- Download the generated configuration file(s).
- Place them in the simulator's specified config directory.
- Connect all physical devices.
- Load the profile in the simulator.
- Calibrate and test all controls.

## üìä Output Format
Each generated profile includes:

**1. Technical Mapping Table**
A detailed table showing:
- **HOTAS Component** (for multi-device)
- **Physical Input** (button/axis names)
- **Device ID** (JOY_BTN1, JOY_X, etc.)
- **Simulator Command**
- **Function & Rationale**

**2. Installation Instructions**
A step-by-step guide including:
- File location
- Profile loading procedure
- Device detection verification
- Calibration steps

**3. Configuration File(s)**
Ready-to-use files in the simulator-native format:
- DCS World: `.lua` files
- MSFS 2020: `.xml` files
- IL-2: `.map` files
- And more...

## üéØ Combat-Focused Priorities
GAMECHANGER prioritizes controls in the following order to ensure mission readiness:

**1. Primary (Essential)**
- **Flight Controls**: Pitch, roll, yaw, throttle
- **Weapons**: Trigger, gun, weapon release, weapon select
- **Sensors**: TDC (Target Designator Control), radar modes

**2. Secondary (Important)**
- **Combat Systems**: Countermeasures, master arm, cage/uncage
- **Essential Flight**: Gear, flaps, speed brake, trim
- **Tactical**: Autopilot, NWS (Nose Wheel Steering), IFF

**3. Tertiary (Nice to Have)**
- **Radio/Communication**: PTT (Push to Talk), radio select
- **Systems Management**: APU, engine start, lights
- **Advanced**: MFD pages, data link, mission systems

## üîß Advanced Features
**Image Extraction**
The system can extract and analyze visual data from PDFs:
- Cockpit layout diagrams
- Control panel schematics
- Button/switch locations
- System flowcharts

**Multi-Device Intelligence**
Automatically handles complex hardware setups:
- Separate stick and throttle identification
- Rudder pedal integration
- Control panel mapping
- Device ID management

**Adaptive Generation**
Creates configurations based on:
- Controller type (unified vs multi-device)
- Available buttons and axes
- Aircraft complexity
- Simulator capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
**Device Not Detected**
- Reconnect USB devices and restart the simulator.
- Check Windows Game Controllers by running `joy.cpl` from the Run dialog (Win+R).
- Try different USB ports (USB 3.0 is recommended over 2.0).

**Wrong Button Mappings**
- Use device testing software to verify button IDs.
- Be aware that device IDs may vary by USB port.
- The connection order of devices can affect their numbering in Windows.

**Axis Not Responding**
- Check axis calibration in the simulator's settings.
- Verify that dead zones are configured correctly.
- Some axes may need to be inverted within the simulator's control settings.

**API Errors**
- Verify that `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is correctly set in your `.env` file.
- Check your API quota limits (the free tier is typically 15 requests/minute).
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

**PDF Extraction Issues**
- Ensure the PDF is not corrupted or password-protected.
- Try reducing image extraction quality or disabling it if the option is available.
- Very large PDFs (>100MB) may cause timeouts.
